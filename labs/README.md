# üß™ SP-API Labs

Welcome to the **SP-API Labs**!  
This directory contains hands-on resources to help you learn and master the **Selling Partner API (SP-API)** through code samples, guided tutorials, and full workshop challenges.

---

## üìÇ Structure

- **`tutorials/`**  
  Step-by-step Jupyter notebooks that guide you through individual workflows.  
  - Ideal if you want to learn and test one API domain in detail.  
  - Example: querying with the Data Kiosk API.

- **`workshops/`**  
  End-to-end labs that combine multiple APIs to solve a real-world problem.  
  - Ideal for deeper learning and real world usecase understandings. 
  - Example: diagnosing listing errors, or building a fulfillment solution with Buy Shipping + MLI.

- **`server/`**  
  A  mock server that powers the [tutorials](https://github.com/amzn/selling-partner-api-samples/tree/hands-on-labs/labs/tutorials) and [workshops](https://github.com/amzn/selling-partner-api-samples/tree/hands-on-labs/labs/workshops).  
  - Run this locally to simulate SP-API endpoints.  
  - **Purpose:** help you understand the **flow of the APIs** without calling SP-API production endpoints.  
  - Example: test Listings Wizard or Shipping Guru without hitting live SP-API.

## Quick Start Command

Open Terminal run the following:
```bash
  cd selling-partner-api-samples/labs/server
  sh setup.sh
```

Open a new terminal and run:
```bash
   cd selling-partner-api-samples/labs
   jupyter lab .
```

üìù This will open Jupyer Lab web version and load the labs directory folder. 
In the directory section of Jupyter you would be able to navigate to different workshops, and tutorials.
